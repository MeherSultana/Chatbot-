# Chatbot
I have developed an interactive Python chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, integrated via LangChain for efficient memory handling, contextual prompts, secure API management, and dynamic, coherent conversational interactions through a modular console-based interface.

I have developed an interactive chatbot application using Python, integrating advanced AI language models from OpenAI (specifically GPT-4o-mini). The chatbot uses LangChain for managing conversations, memory handling, and prompt templates to maintain context and coherence. Your chatbot interacts with users through a console interface, maintaining conversation history and dynamically generating responses based on user input. This implementation showcases effective usage of environment variables for secure API key management and employs a modular, easily maintainable code structure.
